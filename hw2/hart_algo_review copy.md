### 1. Summary

The paper proposes a practical and efficient solution for synchronizing clocks in computer networks,  providing a probablistic way to ensure that the clocks of all nodes in the system remain relatively close to one another, while minimizing the overhead of the synchronization process caused by unbounded random message delays. The algorithm uses a communication protocol that allows nodes in the network to exchange messages in order to estimate the clock offset and drift. The algorithm is based on the concept of round-trip time, which is the time required for a message to be sent and received between two nodes in the network. The round-trip time measurements are used to compute the clock offset and drift between two nodes, and these values are then used to synchronize the clocks. Cristian's algorithm is efficient and scalable, making it suitable for use in large networks, and it is also resilient to network delays and faults.

### 2. Contributions

- This paper introduces a new method for clock synchronization in large-scale, complex distributed systems, which is more accurate and efficient compared to traditional methods such as Network Time Protocol (NTP).
- The algorithm presented in the paper uses a probabilistic approach to achieve clock synchronization, reducing communication overhead and minimizing the impact of network jitter and other sources of variability.
- The algorithm has been widely adopted and used in various real-world systems, including data centers, real-time systems, and other types of distributed computing systems.

### 3. Strengths

- The paper formally proves that the configurations of increasing rate and constant value can minimize the maximum synchronization error in the synchronization protocol.The probabilistic clock reading method described in the paper can improve the precision of internal clock synchronization algorithms to achieve a best effort synchrionzation.
- The probabilistic approach can be used to synchronize clocks in all systems, not just those that guarantee an upper bound on message delays, which is very practical in the system without complex hardware support and adequate computing resources
- The algorithm is efficient, with a number of messages that is linear in the number of processes to be synchronized.
- The new perspective on clock synchronization introduced in the paper has the potential to inspire further research and development.

### 4. Weakness

- The probabilistic method is not deterministic and can't bound the synchronization offset, especially in the presence of congestion that increases the round-trip time (RTT).
- The risk of not achieving synchronization is higher compared to deterministic synchronization protocols.
